# Drag and Drop

This page describes how to enable drag and drop functionality for the various React Spectrum components that support it.

## Introduction

Drag and drop is a common UI interaction that allows users to transfer data between two locations by directly moving a visual representation on screen.
It is a flexible, efficient, and intuitive way for users to perform a variety of tasks, and is widely supported across both desktop and mobile operating systems.
In addition to the standard mouse and touch interactions, React Spectrum also implements keyboard and screen reader accessible alternatives for drag and drop to enable all users to perform these tasks.

## Drag and Drop Concepts

Before we dive into how to enable drag and drop in React Spectrum, let's touch briefly on the terminology and concepts of drag and drop. In a drag and drop operation, there is
a **drag source** and a **drop target**. The drag source is the starting location of your dragged data and the drop target is its intended destination. The dragged data
is made up of one or more **drag items**, each of which contains information specific to their original item within the drag source.

A drag item contains several pieces of information: the **type** of the data, the item's **kind**, and the actual data itself. The type of a drag item can be one of the
[common mime types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) or a custom type specific to your application. Multiple types can be attached to a
single drag item so that the item's data can be provided in different formats for interoperability with various drop targets. For example, an image could be represented by an
`image/jpeg` type and thus be recognized as a JPEG by a file upload drop target but also have a `plain/text` type that allows the image's file name to be communicated to a
text input drop target. In addition, there are two kinds of items: string items include inline data in the form of a Unicode string, and file items include a reference to a file from
the user's computer.

There are several **drop operations** that can be performed in a drag and drop operation: `"move"`, `"copy"`, `"link"`, and `"cancel"`. A `"move"` operation indicates that the dragged data will be
moved from its source location to the target location. A `"copy"` operation indicates that the dragged data will be copied to the target destination. A `"link"` operation indicates that
there will be a relationship established between the source and target locations. Finally, a `"cancel"` operation indicates that the drag and drop operation will be canceled, resulting in
no changes made to the source or target. The drag source can specify what drop operations are allowed for its data, allowing the drop target to decide what operation to perform, using the restrictions
set by the drag source as a guideline.

Collection components, such as ListView, support multiple **drop positions**. The component may support a `"root"` drop position, allowing items to be dropped on the collection as a whole.
It may also support `"on"` drop positions, such as when dropping into a folder in a list. If the collection allows reordering of its items, it could support `"between"` drop positions, allowing the
user to insert or move items between other items. Any number of these drop positions can be allowed at the same time and the component can use the types of the dragged items to selectively allow or disallow certain positions.

### Interaction modes

There are several interaction modes that need to be considered for drag and drop. When using a mouse, you can click an item and drag by holding the mouse button down and moving the pointer. A drop can
be performed by releasing the mouse button or canceled by the <Keyboard>Esc</Keyboard> key. A similar interaction can be performed via touch, with a drag initiated via a long press and a drop performed by
removing your finger from the screen. In both cases, selecting and dragging an item is often accompanied by a **drag preview**. The drag preview is a smaller version of the dragged item that follows the cursor
or touch point. When multiple items are dragged at once, the drag preview displays a stack of items instead, accompanied by a badge reflecting the total number of dragged items. Drop targets are visually highlighted
when dragged over, and the desired drop operation can be controlled via modifier key presses or drop activations via hovering over the drop target for a period of time.

For keyboards, copy and paste shortcuts have traditionally been the alternative method to drag and drop. This comes with many limitations as it is often hard to know where pasting is allowed and difficult to control the
exact positioning of the pasted items. Touch screen readers are even more limited in their ability to perform these operations since they often lack access to a keyboard and thus cannot copy paste in the same manner.

React Spectrum attempts to resolve the above limitations by providing interactive drag affordances that bring a user into drag and drop mode when triggered via keyboard or screen reader virtual click. To perform a drag and drop operation via a keyboard,
first select the items to be dragged by focusing the row and pressing <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard>. You can then start the drag operation by moving focus to the drag handle on any of the selected rows via the arrow keys and hitting <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard>
or <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard>. Once a drag operation is started, you will be automatically brought to the first valid drop target. <Keyboard>Tab</Keyboard> can then be used to cycle through other valid drop targets. For collection components like the ListView above,
<Keyboard>Tab</Keyboard> will move you on or off the overall component itself whereas <Keyboard>ArrowUp</Keyboard> and <Keyboard>ArrowDown</Keyboard> will cycle through the valid drop targets within the component itself. Hitting <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard>
will then confirm the drop operation on the focused drop target. To cancel a drag operation, you can hit <Keyboard>Esc</Keyboard> at any time.

For screen readers, please follow the custom instructions announced when focusing the row's drag handle to begin a drag operation. For screen readers on mobile devices, swiping left and right will
move you between valid drop targets and double tapping will confirm a drop operation. Go ahead and try out drag and drop in the example below!

## Example

```tsx snippet
import {Flex} from '@react-spectrum/layout';

<Flex gap="size-300">
  <DraggableList />
  <DroppableList />
</Flex>
```

### Creating the draggable list

For the first ListView in the example above, we want to make the rows draggable and have the dragged rows removed from the list upon a successful drop. To accomplish this,
we first want to setup the initial list of items for our draggable ListView via [useListData](/react-stately/useListData.html) so that we have access to some helper methods
to modify the list of items on the fly. Note that this is completely optional and is not required to enable drag and drop in React Spectrum. You may substitute `useListData` with
[useAsyncList](/react-stately/useAsyncList.html) or with any other state management solution.

```tsx
let list = useListData({
  initialItems: [
    {id: 'a', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Photoshop'},
    {id: 'b', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe XD'},
    {id: 'c', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Dreamweaver'},
    {id: 'd', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe InDesign'},
    {id: 'e', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Connect'}
  ]
});
```

Next, we need to specify the data associated with each dragged item by returning an array from the `getItems` function. As described above in the [concepts section](#drag-and-drop-concepts), each item includes a mapping of drag types to serialized data.
In this case, we look up the information for each dragged item and serialize it, mapping it to a custom item type. This information will be processed and provided to the drop target's drop handlers on drop.

```tsx
let getItems = (keys) => [...keys].map(key => {
  let item = list.getItem(key);
  return {
    'adobe-app': JSON.stringify(item)
  };
})
```

We also create an `onDragEnd` event handler for `useDnDHooks` that handles removing the dragged items from the draggable list upon a successful drop operation. Note how we use
the `.remove` method provided by `useListData` to remove the dropped items from our list.

```tsx
let onDragEnd = (e) => {
  if (e.dropOperation === 'move') {
    list.remove(...e.keys);
  }
}
```

Finally, we provide our `getItems` and `onDragEnd` functions as options to `useDnDHooks`, providing us with a set of `dndHooks` that we can pass to our ListView directly.
Below is what our draggable ListView would look like after combining everything together. For more info on `getItems` and `onDragEnd`, see the [API section](#useDnDHooks) below.

```tsx example export=true render=false
import {Item, ListView} from '@react-spectrum/list';
import {useDnDHooks} from '@react-spectrum/dnd';
import {useListData} from '@react-stately/data';

function DraggableList() {
  let list = useListData({
    initialItems: [
      {id: 'a', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Photoshop'},
      {id: 'b', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe XD'},
      {id: 'c', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Dreamweaver'},
      {id: 'd', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe InDesign'},
      {id: 'e', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Connect'}
    ]
  });

  let {dndHooks} = useDnDHooks({
    getItems: (keys) => [...keys].map(key => {
      let item = list.getItem(key);
      return {
        'adobe-app': JSON.stringify(item)
      };
    }),
    onDragEnd: (e) => {
      if (e.dropOperation === 'move') {
        list.remove(...e.keys);
      }
    }
  });

  return (
    <ListView
      aria-label="Draggable list view example"
      width="size-3600"
      height="size-3600"
      selectionMode="multiple"
      items={list.items}
      dndHooks={dndHooks}>
      {item => (
        <Item textValue={item.name}>
          {item.name}
        </Item>
      )}
    </ListView>
  );
}
```

### Creating the droppable list


Due to the possible complexity of a droppable collection's behavior, `useDnDHooks` accepts various [high level drop event handlers and options](#high-level-drop-handlers-and-options) that help you enable common drop behaviors like
reordering or item insertion operations. If you find that you need greater control over the drop behavior, you can use `onDrop` and `getDropOperation` instead as demonstrated [below](#low-level-api).

For a more general explanation of these low level options, see the `useDroppableCollection` aria [docs](/react-aria/useDroppableCollection.html#low-level-api).

#### Using high level options

For the second ListView we want to make it droppable, accepting drops between items and onto folders but not at the root of the list. Similar to the draggable ListView, we'll start by initializing the default item list
via [useListData](/react-stately/useListData.html). As a reminder, `useListData` is completely optional here and can be replaced by [useAsyncList](/react-stately/useAsyncList.html) or any other state management solution.

```tsx
let list = useListData({
  initialItems: [
    {id: 'f', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe AfterEffects'},
    {id: 'g', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Illustrator'},
    {id: 'h', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Lightroom'},
    {id: 'i', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Premiere Pro'},
    {id: 'j', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Fresco'},
    {id: 'k', type: 'folder', name: 'Apps',  childNodes: []}
  ]
});
```

Since we only want to accept items from the first ListView, we setup an array containing our custom type that will be provided to `useDnDHooks`'s `acceptedDragTypes` option.

```tsx
let acceptedDragTypes = ['adobe-app'];
```

To handle the processing of the drop item data, we create a `itemProcessor` utility function that will be used in each of the drop handlers. See the [aria docs](/react-aria/useDroppableCollection.html#drop-data)
for more information on the drop items provided to the drop handlers.

```tsx
let itemProcessor = async (items, acceptedDragTypes) => {
  let processedItems = [];
  let text;
  for (let item of items) {
    for (let type of acceptedDragTypes) {
      if (item.kind === 'text' && item.types.has(type)) {
        text = await item.getText(type);
        processedItems.push(JSON.parse(text));
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  return processedItems;
};
```

Next, we can add support for insertion drops by providing a `onInsert` handler. This handler uses the relative drop position to insert the dropped
items before or after the target item.

```tsx
let onInsert = async (e) => {
  let {
    items,
    target
  } = e;
  let processedItems = await itemProcessor(items, acceptedDragTypes);

  if (target.dropPosition === 'before') {
    list.insertBefore(target.key, ...processedItems);
  } else if (target.dropPosition === 'after') {
    list.insertAfter(target.key, ...processedItems);
  }
}
```

Similarly, item drops are enabled by providing a `onItemDrop` handler. The folder's contents are updated by using `list.update` to add the dropped items to
the folder's `childNodes`. To ensure that we can only drop on the folder in the droppable list, we create a `shouldAcceptItemDrop` function that only returns `true`
if the drop target has `childNodes`.

```tsx
let onItemDrop = async (e) => {
  let {
    items,
    target
  } = e;
  let processedItems = await itemProcessor(items, acceptedDragTypes);
  let targetItem = list.getItem(target.key);
  list.update(target.key, {...targetItem, childNodes: [...targetItem.childNodes, ...processedItems]});
}

let shouldAcceptItemDrop = (target) => !!list.getItem(target.key).childNodes;
```

Below is what our droppable ListView would look like after combining everything together. By not supplying a `onRootDrop` handler to `useDnDHooks`, we automatically
exclude the root of the droppable list from the drop targets reachable via any of the drag and drop interaction modes. For more information on the options used above,
please see the [API section](#useDnDHooks) below.

```tsx example export=true render=false
import Folder from '@spectrum-icons/illustrations/Folder';
import {Text} from '@react-spectrum/text';
import {useDnDHooks} from '@react-spectrum/dnd';

function DroppableList() {
  let list = useListData({
    initialItems: [
      {id: 'f', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe AfterEffects'},
      {id: 'g', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Illustrator'},
      {id: 'h', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Lightroom'},
      {id: 'i', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Premiere Pro'},
      {id: 'j', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Fresco'},
      {id: 'k', type: 'folder', name: 'Apps',  childNodes: []}
    ]
  });
  let acceptedDragTypes = ['adobe-app'];
  let itemProcessor = async (items, acceptedDragTypes) => {
    let processedItems = [];
    let text;
    for (let item of items) {
      for (let type of acceptedDragTypes) {
        if (item.kind === 'text' && item.types.has(type)) {
          text = await item.getText(type);
          processedItems.push(JSON.parse(text));
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    return processedItems;
  };

  let {dndHooks} = useDnDHooks({
    onInsert: async (e) => {
      let {
        items,
        target
      } = e;
      let processedItems = await itemProcessor(items, acceptedDragTypes);

      if (target.dropPosition === 'before') {
        list.insertBefore(target.key, ...processedItems);
      } else if (target.dropPosition === 'after') {
        list.insertAfter(target.key, ...processedItems);
      }
    },
    onItemDrop: async (e) => {
      let {
        items,
        target
      } = e;
      let processedItems = await itemProcessor(items, acceptedDragTypes);
      let targetItem = list.getItem(target.key);
      list.update(target.key, {...targetItem, childNodes: [...targetItem.childNodes, ...processedItems]});
    },
    acceptedDragTypes,
    shouldAcceptItemDrop: (target) => !!list.getItem(target.key).childNodes
  });

  return (
    <ListView
      aria-label="Droppable list view example"
      width="size-3600"
      height="size-3600"
      selectionMode="multiple"
      items={list.items}
      dndHooks={dndHooks}>
      {item => (
        <Item textValue={item.name} hasChildItems={item.type === 'folder'}>
          {item.type === 'folder' && <Folder />}
          <Text>{item.name}</Text>
          {item.type === 'folder' &&
            <Text slot="description">{`contains ${item.childNodes.length} dropped item(s)`}</Text>
          }
        </Item>
      )}
    </ListView>
  );
}
```

#### Low level API

As mentioned previously, the above example makes use of several high level events and options supported by `useDnDHooks` to define the droppable ListView's behavior. The same behavior can be defined using the `onDrop` event and
`getDropOperation` function instead.

First, we must implement the `onDrop` event handler that handles updating the droppable list for insertion and on folder drops. This handler serves as a replacement for the previous `onInsert` and `onItemDrop` handler options.

```tsx
let onDrop = async (e) => {
  let {
    items,
    target
  } = e;
  let processedItems = await itemProcessor(items, acceptedDragTypes);
  if (target.type === 'item') {
    if (target.dropPosition === 'before') {
      list.insertBefore(target.key, ...processedItems);
    } else if (target.dropPosition === 'after') {
      list.insertAfter(target.key, ...processedItems);
    } else {
      let targetItem = list.getItem(target.key);
      list.update(target.key, {...targetItem, childNodes: [...targetItem.childNodes, ...processedItems]});
    }
  }
}
```

Next, we need to implement a `getDropOperation` function that cancels any drop operations that are not a folder or insertion drop. It uses the current drop target, relative drop position, and the drop operations allowed by the drag source to determine the final drop operation.

Note that `acceptedDragTypes` can still be used alongside `getDropOperation` where it acts as a pre-filter that rejects any drag operations that do not contain any of the drag types defined within `acceptedDragTypes`. We will be
using the same `acceptedDragTypes` from the previous example so that we don't need to perform any drag types checks within our `getDropOperation`. If you were to implement a more complex scenario, such as only allowing on folder drops if
the dragged items were of a specific mime type, you can use the `types` in `getDropOperation` to check the drag types of the current drag operation.

```tsx
let getDropOperation = (target, types, allowedOperations) => {
  let isFolderDrop = target.type === 'item' && target.dropPosition === 'on' && !!list.getItem(target.key).childNodes;
  let isInsert = target.type === 'item' && target.dropPosition !== 'on';
  if (isFolderDrop || isInsert) {
    return allowedOperations[0];
  }

  return 'cancel';
}

let acceptedDragTypes = ['adobe-app'];
```

Below is what our droppable ListView would look like after combining everything together.

```tsx
function DroppableListLowLevelAPI() {
  let list = useListData({
    initialItems: [
      {id: 'f', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe AfterEffects'},
      {id: 'g', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Illustrator'},
      {id: 'h', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Lightroom'},
      {id: 'i', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Premiere Pro'},
      {id: 'j', type: 'file', name: 'Adobe Fresco'},
      {id: 'k', type: 'folder', name: 'Apps',  childNodes: []}
    ]
  });
  let acceptedDragTypes = ['adobe-app'];
  let itemProcessor = async (items, acceptedDragTypes) => {
    let processedItems = [];
    let text;
    for (let item of items) {
      for (let type of acceptedDragTypes) {
        if (item.kind === 'text' && item.types.has(type)) {
          text = await item.getText(type);
          processedItems.push(JSON.parse(text));
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    return processedItems;
  };

  let {dndHooks} = useDnDHooks({
    onDrop: async (e) => {
      let {
        items,
        target
      } = e;
      let processedItems = await itemProcessor(items, acceptedDragTypes);
      if (target.type === 'item') {
        if (target.dropPosition === 'before') {
          list.insertBefore(target.key, ...processedItems);
        } else if (target.dropPosition === 'after') {
          list.insertAfter(target.key, ...processedItems);
        } else {
          let targetItem = list.getItem(target.key);
          list.update(target.key, {...targetItem, childNodes: [...targetItem.childNodes, ...processedItems]});
        }
      }
    },
    getDropOperation: (target, _, allowedOperations) => {
      let isFolderDrop = target.type === 'item' && target.dropPosition === 'on' && !!list.getItem(target.key).childNodes;
      let isInsert = target.type === 'item' && target.dropPosition !== 'on';
      if (isFolderDrop || isInsert) {
        return allowedOperations[0];
      }

      return 'cancel';
    },
    acceptedDragTypes
  });

  return (
    <ListView
      aria-label="Droppable list view example"
      width="size-3600"
      height="size-3600"
      selectionMode="multiple"
      items={list.items}
      dndHooks={dndHooks}>
      {item => (
        <Item textValue={item.name} hasChildItems={item.type === 'folder'}>
          {item.type === 'folder' && <Folder />}
          <Text>{item.name}</Text>
          {item.type === 'folder' &&
            <Text slot="description">{`contains ${item.childNodes.length} dropped item(s)`}</Text>
          }
        </Item>
      )}
    </ListView>
  );
}
```

## API

As seen in the [example](#example) above, enabling drag and drop for a supported React Spectrum component differs slightly from the typical event handler prop pattern that you may be familiar with.
Instead of providing each event handler directly to the component, you must first import `useDnDHooks` from the `@react-spectrum/dnd` package and provide this hook with your desired options.
`useDnDHooks` will then provide you with a set of hooks that you can pass to the component via its `dndHooks` prop, thus enabling drag and drop operations for the component. This approach allows the drag and drop
implementation to be included only when used, keeping bundle sizes small when unused by an application.

Whether the component supports drag operations, drop operations, or both all depends on the options you provide to the `useDnDHooks`. If you omit the `getItems` option, the component will not be draggable. Alternatively, if
you don't provide a `onDrop` handler or any of the high level drop handlers (`onInsert`/`onItemDrop`/`onReorder`/`onRootDrop`) to `useDnDHooks` then the component will not be droppable.

### High level drop handlers and options
<TypeContext.Provider value={dndDocs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={dndDocs.exports.UtilityOptions.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

As demonstrated in the [example](#using-high-level-options), `useDnDHooks` accepts a set of high level drop handlers and options. Providing any of these high level drop handlers will enable the corresponding
drop behavior in your component (e.g. if you provide `onReorder`, internal insertion drop operations are enabled, provided the component is draggable as well). `acceptedDragTypes` allows
you to control what types of drag items your droppable component should accept and `shouldAcceptItemDrop` gives you a greater degree of control over whether an item in your component is a valid drop target. Providing
these two options will also automatically filter out any invalid drag items from the list of items provided to the drop handlers.

### useDnDHooks
<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useDnDHooks} links={docs.links} />
<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.exports.DnDOptions.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

Of the various hook options above, `getAllowedDropOperations` and `getDropOperation` may be of particular interest since it allows you to specify what kinds of drag and drop operations you want to allow.
When the dragged items are dropped on a drop target created using the React Aria drag and drop hooks, the allowed drop operations you return in `getAllowedDropOperations`
are provided to the drop target's `getDropOperation`, giving the drop target extra information to use when deciding what drop operation to execute. This in turn provides
the `onDragEnd` and `onDrop` handlers with the executed drop operation, allowing you to decide what to do with the dragged items in your original component and in the dropped component.

For instance, you may have a draggable collection of items that allows `"move"` and `"copy"` operations but you need a way to know whether or not you should be removing the dragged items
from the list after a drop operation. A drop target that only allows `"copy"` operations, such as a file upload drop zone, would be able to return `"copy"` from its `getDropOperation` and communicate that
to your draggable collection's `onDragEnd` handler, letting the draggable collection know that it shouldn't remove the dragged items from its list. Alternatively, a drop target that allows `"move"` operations, like in the
[example](#example) above, would return `move` from its `getDropOperation` and thus inform your draggable collection to remove the dragged items from its list.


## Supported components

The following list shows which components currently support drag and drop. Common drag and drop implementations are included in each component's documentation so definitely take a look!
